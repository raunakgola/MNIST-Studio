# ‚ö° MNIST-Studio

A full-stack MNIST digit visualization and prediction tool built with React frontend and FastAPI backend. This interactive application allows users to draw digits on a 28√ó28 pixel grid and get real-time predictions using a trained deep learning model.

## üåü Features

**Interactive Drawing Interface**
- 28√ó28 pixel drawing grid that mirrors the MNIST dataset format
- Real-time pixel value extraction and visualization
- Responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop devices
- Intuitive drawing controls with clear and reset functionality

**Deep Learning Pipeline**
- Containerized deep learning inference system
- FastAPI backend for high-performance model serving
- Real-time digit classification with confidence scores
- Optimized model architecture for quick predictions

**Full-Stack Architecture**
- Modern React frontend with component-based design
- RESTful API backend built with FastAPI
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Configure the server URL by updating the environment file with your backend endpoint, then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your development server).

### Backend Setup

The backend requires a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively. First, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages from the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r api_requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI server using the following command:

```bash
python -u "c:\Users\Raunak Gola\test\Server.py"
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` with automatic documentation available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

For a streamlined deployment experience, pre-built Docker containers are available on Docker Hub. This approach eliminates the need for local environment setup and ensures consistent performance across different systems.

### Pull Docker Images

First, pull the pre-built images from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull raunakgola123/mnist-frontend:latest
docker pull raunakgola123/mnist-backend:latest
```

### Run Frontend Container

Launch the frontend container with port mapping:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 raunakgola123/mnist-frontend:latest
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Run Backend Container

Start the backend container with logging configuration and port mapping:

```bash
docker run -d --name mnist-api-container \
  --log-driver=json-file \
  --log-opt max-size=10m \
  --log-opt max-file=3 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  raunakgola123/mnist-backend:latest
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
